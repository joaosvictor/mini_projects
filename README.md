### Just some codes that I developed to practice.

### Here I put some python and cpp(+python) codes.

#### Some algorithms are in the code mode and not in library one. Some day I'll modify it. 

-----
#### Check the libraries here.

```
pip install numpy
pip install PySDL2
pip install turtle
pip install compressed-deque
pip install PySimpleGUI
